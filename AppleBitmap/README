This is a tool for encoding and decoding bitmap data in apple format.

While browsing the filesystem of my iPod touch, I found a file in /var/mobile/Library/Caches/ called com.apple.SpringBoard.folderSwitcherLinen
It didn't seem to be of a recognised or documented format; so, being a curious person, I opened it up in a hex editor. 
I had a hunch that it would be the same image as /System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/FolderSwitcherBG.png
Armed with that file I set to work reverse-engineering it.
By modifying /System/Library/CoreServices/SpringBoard.app/FolderSwitcherBG.png, and allowing the device to regenerate the cache copy,
I was able to determine the purpose of some of the header entries.

The header seems to consist of the following:

HEADER:
32-bit int: header size in bytes.
32-bit int: image width in pixels.
32-bit int: image height in pixels.
32-bit int: image width in pixels multiplied by 4. Unknown purpose.
32-bit int: constant 8 in all tests. Unknown purpose.
32-bit int: constant 32 in all tests. Unknown purpose. Possibly bits-per-pixel.
32-bit int: constant 8194 in all tests. Unknown purpose.
The header is then padded with nulls until it matches the length specified earlier.

After the header is the raw bitmap data in BGRA format.

This probably doesn't have much (if any) practical use. I just made it because I was bored and curious.
